Mikhail Davydov wrote a tool called [bem-cli](https://github.com/bem/bem-cli) that launches locally 
installed [bem-tools](http://bem.info/tools/bem/).

Sometimes BEM-projects have different versions of bem-tools, and you can not simply run `npm i -g bem` 
to install bem-tools globally. Also there may be other reasons such as lack of root privileges.

We also recommend you [to install bem-tools locally](http://bem.info/tools/bem/installation/) with `npm i bem` 
to prevent conflicts with other BEM-projects.

Locally installed bem can seem inconvenient to use. You have to run bem from project root, typing the full path to the
bin/bem script `./node_modules/.bin/bem make`. You may also create a symbolic link `ln -s ./node_modules/.bin/bem` 
and run it like this `./bem` or add the path of your local `./node_modules/.bin` directory to the environment 
variable `PATH`. There are many ways to do that, for example, [smartcd](http://bem.info/articles/smartcd/).

Inspired by [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) project, Mikhail created [bem-cli](https://github.com/bem/bem-cli/blob/master/bin/bem) - 
a tool that finds local or global bem-tools and runs it as if it was installed globally.

Install bem-cli globally with  `npm i -g bem-cli`, and you will have access to the `bem` command anywhere on your system.
