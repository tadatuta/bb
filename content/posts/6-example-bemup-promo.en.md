[BEMup](http://bitly.com/bemup), our first meetup about BEM was on August 2, in the Moscow office of Yandex.

For 3 hours in a friendly atmosphere Yandex developers and programmers from other IT companies shared news, 
BEM implementation experience, discussed plans, difficulties and ways of solving them.

The BEM team talked about latest releases in [bem-tools](http://bit.ly/ru-bemtools), shared details of 
[bem-core](http://github.com/bem/bem-core) development and plans about [bem-bl](https://github.com/bem/bem-bl) 
future, and discussed their thoughts on opensource development and the community we are building around BEM. 

We also explained technical details of contributing to the project, what “well-written pull requests” are, 
the workflow in BEM development, how to test changes in BEM-project correctly, and what you can do to 
help develop BEM.

During the preparation time we got talk proposals from other developers outside Yandex. 

We ended up with 2 developers sharing their BEM implementation experience: 
[Vassily Chernov](https://twitter.com/bivihoba), lead frontend developer at **Softline**, came from Orenburg, 
and [Vladimir Dovydenko](https://twitter.com/dovyden), frontend developer from **TKS Bank**, Moscow. 

They talked about the conditions under which they implement BEM in their projects, what cases they solve using 
BEM-methodology, how they use tools and write CSS, their difficulties and the costs they have because of large-scale changes, what results they have achieved and what plans they have.

As a bonus we had talks about [bem-mvc](https://github.com/bem/bem-mvc) library, with Todo written as an 
example, and implementation of BEM technologies in Islands platform that Yandex launched recently.

[Vassily Chernov](https://twitter.com/bivihoba), lead frontend developer at **Softline** and speaker, 
shared what he liked about BEMup:

> The meetup was a success. I do not know how such events should be, but everything went pretty well.  I had 
concrete expectations, and my expectations were met. It is worth a lot to look in the eyes of those who have the same 'BEM brain' as I do! It was interesting to listen to the talks and comments of Yandex developers and guys from the industry. 

> I would like to highlight a talk about Islands libraries. It would be great to have more details such as this 
talk was about. It is interesting to hear about real projects, solutions, and not only from Yandex, as well 
as to ask questions and even troll. Personally I was asked more about processes than technologies. How to prove BEM 
is a good choice to my colleagues? How many projects we do using BEM? How to agree with each other? How 
to start with a block library out of your project? 

> I really hope you will continue this start, and BEMups will be regular events. Because this is a great option to 
exchange experience and motivate yourself to achieve the next BEM level. I, for instance, was inspired to 
finish a something I postponed for half a year! Thanks to Yandex and you guys for such an event. Staying BEMed, 
Vasya.

The BEM team also made few conclusions.

[Mikhail Troshev](http://twitter.com/ya_mishanga):

> Developers use our project-stub, we need to keep it in an up-to-date fixed and working condition. This is a BEM face 
for most of the people.

[Sergey Berezhnoy](http://twitter.com/veged):

> During a coffee break I heard some developers talk to each other about how they use BEM technologies 
and how they implemented them. It is cool that non-Yandex developers argued for BEM before the others.

> We need to continue BEMuping but think twice what we give developers, why they come to BEMup and are going 
to come. For instance, several people said they lack concrete technical examples and talks (maybe even workshops). 
We may not need to go that way, but we need to formulate the essence of the event first.

[Vladimir Grinenko](http://twitter.com/tadatuta):

> I was surprised to see such a high percentage of developers using bem-tools. I thought I would need to explain what 
bem-tools are before getting into news. But they knew already! 

[Sergey Maksimov](http://twitter.com/dosyara):

> The meetup went well. Those who came really use the idea and believe in it. Without such an audience the result might 
be different. I think it is worthwhile to ask external speakers to share not only their «success stories» but more 
concrete examples of realization.

> The overall feeling still associates BEM with a naming convention and with structuring a page with blocks, elements, all that stuff. Those who tried to go further and use Yandex' experience faced imperfection and opacity of our inner processes. For instance, an absence of development plans, clear release cycles, absence (or bad quality) of documentation. There are serious issues for a serious development. 

Thanks to the meetup we have all this feedback (and more). We will be working towards an 
improvement of the product and sharing this with you during future BEMups. 

Such events and your feedback help us a lot to see those we can not see because of specifics of work. Thank you so much!

More than **50 frontend developers** and IT leaders from Moscow, Ekaterinburg, Orenburg, Ivanovo, Serpukhov, Obninsk, Volgograd came to meetup.

Watch how we did it in a promo video with English subtitles.
