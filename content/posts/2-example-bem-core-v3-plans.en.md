Hi!

If you are subscribed to our repositories, you already know that we defined [a preliminary scope](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues?milestone=6&state=open) of tasks that would be developed in bem-core v3.

The major focus we will have on i-bem.js API improvement. 

How we plan to do this?

**First of all**, we plan fairly [divide i-bem and i-bem__dom](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/413) into 2 different block-modules. This will increase the accuracy of the API, in particular its methods-helpers will be separated from JS classes.

**Second of all**, we plan to support an ability to work with blocks' elements as with i-bem-objects on core level instead of treating them as jQuery-collections. Currently similar functionality is available with `elem-instances` modifier of `i-bem`. This will allow us to escape odds with simultaneous existence of elements as jQuery-objects and BEM-instances and create better API (instead of `this.setMod(this.elem('e1'), 'm1', 'v1')` we will have `this.elem('e1').setMod('m1', 'v1')`). This will also allow to escape the difficult polymorphism of a number of methods inside the core.

**In third place**, we will improve implementation of [collection's support](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/582) for blocks and elements.

**Fourthly**, `ym` module system integration will become more tight — block search methods (for instance, `.findBlockInside('b1')`) instead of strings will receive concrete classes of blocks (not clear «magic» will disappear and there will be less potential mistakes).

**Fifthly**, we will think of how to [unify work with events, especially with live-BEM-events](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/394).

**Besides**, we will [implement i18n support](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/576) in much simple way than in bem-bl, [will update bem-xjst version](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/491) that allows us not to wrap in additional guards from cycling apply* constructions in BEMHTML and BEMTREE and will make a number of smaller changes.

While we plan development process we would like to **ask your feedback** on whether will such changes ease the work with library or we need to do something else?

If you have and would like to **propose tasks** for v3 — please, do [create an issue](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/new), we will be more than happy!
