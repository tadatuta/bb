Hi! 

We are frequently asked about what do we mean by “technologies” in BEM, what kind of them we have, how do they work and so on. Let us explain :)

## Definition of “technology” (techs)

While writing about BEM we use two terms to define technology — “tech” and “technology”. Do not be afraid of that :) Is there any difference? There is none. However, there are plenty of technologies in BEM, and not to be mistaken or misunderstood, let us sort them through to you.  

When we write “tech” or “technology”, we usually mean the following:

First of all, common web-technologies that are used to implement behavior or appearance of the blocks, elements and modifiers:
* CSS for appearance;
* JavaScript implementation for dynamic behavior;
* templates (XSL, TT2, JavaScript, etc.) that convert page declaration into HTML-code;
* images related to BEM entity;
* documentation.

For instance, when we have my-block.css file that declares block's appearance, we say that block was implemented using CSS technology.

Second of all, we have a number of own technologies — ([BEMHTML](http://bem.info/technology/bemhtml/current/reference/), [BEMTREE](http://bem.info/technology/bemtree/current/bemtree/), [BEMJSON](http://bem.info/technology/bemjson/current/bemjson/), [i-bem.js](http://bem.info/tutorials/bem-js-tutorial/)) that are our implementation of [BEM methodology](http://bem.info/method/).

Thirdly, there are “[tech modules](http://bem.info/tools/bem/bem-tools/tech-modules/)” — files that are used by building tools such as bem-tools or ENB to build bundles.

Fourthly, we use [borschik](http://bem.info/tools/optimizers/borschik/) that rely on its own building technologies.

Thus, depending on a context we can mean something from up above saying “tech” or “technology” or use it as a collective sense: “space technology”, “BEM technology”.

We hope we cleared that up for you. Let us move on.

## Site navigation improvement, “Technologies” section

From now on everything about technologies listed in the second paragraph will appear in our new section called “[Technologies](http://bem.info/technology/)” on bem.info. We set it up to ease in our point of view a life of users and make navigation on site be more native and understandable. Related information about BEMHTML, BEMTREE, BEMJSON and i-bem.js we group according to [bem-core](http://bem.info/libs/bem-core/) libraries versions.

Besides the new section “Technologies” on site we have made some more changes.

We deleted outdated versions of bem-core library's documentation in the “Libraries” section, because it was not covering everything, and added subparagraph called “Documentation”. It leads us on click to the page with tags selection corresponding with the selected version of the chosen library.

## Publishing at bem.info

We also checked “Tutorials” and “Articles” sections. First now gathers materials about how to do something step by step, containing instructions or practical knowledge. Second will contain more common materials about BEM including those that are written not by our team but by BEM-community developers including those that were published in some place else. 

If you know such articles and think they might be handy to be published at bem.info; moreover, you wrote such articles by yourself and want them to be published here — email us at [info@bem.info](mailto:info@bem.info), and we will be happy to do so.

If you notice a mistake, 404 or know how to improve usability on the site, do not stay silent, our mailbox [info@bem.info](mailto:info@bem.info) is waiting for your emails!
