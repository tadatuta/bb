According to plan, we renamed the bem-controls repository to bem-components.

For backward compatibility the [bem-controls](https://github.com/bem/bem-controls/) repository contains a 
copy with issues disabled, that was created at the moment of renaming.

Unfortunately, we have broken old links to issues. If you need them, you need to change the "bem-controls" part of the url to "bem-components" - eg https://github.com/bem/bem-controls/issues/106 becomes https://github.com/bem/bem-components/issues/106 - manually.

It is impossible to create read-only repository. Therefore please try not to push anything there. 
If you accidently do, please push the same commit to [bem-components](https://github.com/bem/bem-components/).
